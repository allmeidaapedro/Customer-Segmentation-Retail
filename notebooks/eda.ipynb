    "# Machine learning customer segmentation project\n",
    "In this project, I will build a machine learning model for customer segmentation. It involves unsupervised learning, using an unlabeled training set for clustering. I intend to perform clustering to summarize customer segments of a retail store, identifying an ideal client group and building a loyalty program.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the following pipeline, based on CRISP-DM framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the business problem.\n",
    "2. Initial data understanding.\n",
    "3. Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.\n",
    "4. Data cleaning and preprocessing.\n",
    "5. Group customers into clusters, modelling.\n",
    "6. Interpret the results, analysing the groups created (profiling). \n",
    "7. Provide marketing suggestions and the loyalty program.\n",
    "8. Estimate financial results."

    "Problem statement:\n",
    "- A retail store aims to gain a deeper understanding of its customer characteristics and to strategically utilize this knowledge. One of its primary goals is to proficiently segment its clientele, allowing for enhanced comprehension of its customers' preferences. This, in turn, facilitates the adaptation of products to cater to the unique requirements, behaviors, and concerns of various customer segments.\n",
    "- Additionally, the store wants to build better connections with customers and keep them coming back by starting a loyalty program. They'll look closely at how customers behave, what they buy, and what they like. Then, they'll create a loyalty program with special rewards and benefits just for different groups of customers. This special treatment doesn't just keep customers coming back; it also makes them feel valued and part of the store's family, which makes them like the brand even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the RFM model for clustering analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RFM model is a marketing and customer segmentation technique used to analyze and categorize customers based on their recent purchasing behavior. RFM stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recency: This measures how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are typically considered more valuable.\n",
    "- Frequency: This measures how often a customer makes purchases. Customers who make frequent purchases are often more engaged and loyal.\n",
    "- Monetary Value: This assesses the amount of money a customer has spent on purchases. Customers who have spent more are usually considered higher-value customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these three factors, businesses can categorize their customers into different segments, such as \"high-value and highly engaged\" or \"low-value and inactive.\" This segmentation allows companies to tailor their marketing strategies and offers to each group more effectively, ultimately improving customer retention and maximizing revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering everything mentioned above, the project objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify customer groups and create profiles for them. By doing this, it will be possible to assess common characteristics of client segments, such as product preferences and demographic information.\n",
    "2. Design a loyalty program based on an ideal customer group with the intention of improving client retention and increasing revenue.\n",
    "3. Achieve satisfactory financial results through customer segmentation and the loyalty program, which will be estimated in final steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, the business problem will be resolved."
